# Supabase database CA

`supabase-ca.crt` is the public Supabase Root 2021 CA certificate downloaded from:

https://supabase-downloads.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/ssl/prod-ca-2021.crt

SHA-256: `80:70:25:AD:50:D4:ED:21:9D:2C:9C:7D:29:9C:00:4F:82:4E:B0:0C:F7:F6:5A:FE:F6:07:D0:7B:72:E6:CA:FA`

Valid until April 26, 2031. This is a public trust certificate, not a private key.
Supabase connections use `sslmode=verify-full` with this certificate unless an
explicit `sslrootcert` is supplied. Other PostgreSQL providers are unchanged.
